# coursera-transcript-edit
A script that makes the transcript of Coursera videos translatable and readable.

Coursera only provides support for English-language videos, at least for the courses that I have watched. This means that there are no translations or subtitles available for videos in other languages. However, I have created a bash script file that edits transcripts for these videos to make them more easily readable and translatable.
